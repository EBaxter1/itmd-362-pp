# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/buttons/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
	Added verds to system button to log in
	Would like infor buttons under announcements so they can click if they want to see more 
	All titles are short 1-2 words

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/animation/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
	Login and forgot un/pass light up 
	Announcement buttons on click will have button expand and then have text slide down from button to create box ad upon clicking anywhere in box it will go back into button. 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/3d-touch/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
	Announcement buttons if hovered on or holding pressure show first couple items
	Need help link if put pressure on explain what this page is for and says if you are new student to click the link to go to OTS page
