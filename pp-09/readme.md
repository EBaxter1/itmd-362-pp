# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.http://drpete.co/?topic=25-point-website-usability-checklist
2.https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Easy to read text 
2. Touch friendly inputs
3. Simple but eye catching logos 
4. Hearing/sight impired backups such as menus being read after the page title
5. Clear error messages 
6. Direct title names, such as Log-in Page, Course Informaiton
7. Having the least amount of redircts possible, i.e not having a different page to say login error 
8. Use placeholders for text inputs
9. Append errors to display on page rather then having pop-ups
10. Eye-friendly colors for pages that are consistent for whole website
