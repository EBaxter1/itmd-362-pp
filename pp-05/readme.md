## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=14e0u0kic003J++4VhICW++++7l
Your Rationale: My choice is based on Playstation, their newest console used black for the body and blue for lights. I followed that but added some gray which would be for some stripes of color and also a little darker blue which would be for another mode.  

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32-0q0kohG700++lel+tr9h++vD
Your Rationale: I picked green as my main color because most of the colors at the garden I feel will be green. The purples and reds are because they are common flower colors.

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=3340c1kqddl00++8Pvwbu8El0hukohG7qLUQlel+tr9h++vDkohG700++XW++tr9h++vD
